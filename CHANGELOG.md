# Changelog

All notable changes to `@yawlabs/electron-mcp` will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- New tool `electron_knowledge_version` returning metadata about the embedded Electron knowledge (last-verified date, Electron stable at verification, supported version range, source URLs).
- Knowledge-freshness footer appended to every knowledge-bearing tool response so AI consumers always know the vintage of embedded advice.
- `KNOWLEDGE.md` documenting the embedded-knowledge update checklist when Electron ships a new major.
- Integration test suite that spawns the built binary and exercises it through the real MCP SDK stdio client (tool list, tool call, error path, version subcommand, footer injection).
- Behavioral tests for every tool (previously only 4 of 17 tools had behavioral coverage). Total tests grew from 11 to 55.

### Fixed
- `electron_audit_ipc_security` no longer produces a false-positive "raw ipcRenderer exposure" finding when the preload wraps `ipcRenderer.invoke`/`.on`/`.send` inside a closure. The detection regex now only matches `ipcRenderer` when it's a bare value in the exposed object, not when it's a call target.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- Initial release with 17 tools: IPC scaffolding (5), security auditing (4), build & distribution (4), version migration (2), performance (1), reference (1).
- Zero runtime dependencies (single bundled `dist/index.js`).
- CI release workflow on `v*` tags using org-scoped `NPM_TOKEN`.
