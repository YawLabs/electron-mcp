/**
 * Runtime launcher for @yawlabs/electron-mcp.
 *
 * Prefers the newest usable oam runtime (https://oamjs.org) and falls back to
 * Node. It never serves on an oam older than the floor below.
 *
 *
 * WHY THE FALLBACK COSTS NOTHING
 * npm has already started Node to run this launcher, so falling back is a
 * plain `import()` of the server into THIS process: no extra spawn, no extra
 * startup, byte-identical to invoking dist/index.js directly. Finding the
 * candidates is stat-only, so a machine without oam never pays for a
 * subprocess.
 *
 * WHAT THE OAM PATH COSTS
 * Reaching oam through an npm `bin` means Node boots first, every oam binary
 * found is asked for its version, and then oam boots to serve -- so the
 * launcher is slower than pointing a host at oam directly. Measured on
 * npmjs-mcp (windows-arm64, n=12 medians, spawn to first MCP initialize):
 * oam 116ms, node 172ms, launcher 243ms. It exists for `npx` convenience.
 *
 * For an MCP host config, point straight at oam and skip this file:
 *   { "command": "oam", "args": ["run", "<abs>/dist/index.js"] }
 *
 * WHICH OAM
 * OAM_BIN, when set and usable, is used as given. Otherwise every oam binary
 * discovery can see -- the installed locations, then PATH -- is asked for its
 * version, and the NEWEST one at or above the floor wins; a tie keeps search
 * order. Taking the first binary found instead let a stale copy early in the
 * search order hide a current one later: with oam 0.9.0 installed in ~/.oam/bin
 * and 0.15.2 on PATH, the launcher bound to 0.9.0 because installed locations
 * are searched first.
 *
 * An OAM_BIN that does not exist, is below the floor, or will not run is always
 * named on stderr, and discovery carries on. It used to stop everything: a typo
 * in OAM_BIN meant Node, with no hint why. Discovered binaries passed over for a
 * newer one, and any Windows oam.cmd/oam.bat shim, are named on stderr only
 * when NO usable oam is found; when one is chosen they go unmentioned.
 *
 * ALREADY RUNNING ON OAM
 * A host can resolve this package's `bin` and launch `oam run <this file>`
 * instead of `node <this file>` -- Yaw MCP does, and so does oam's sidecar
 * regression matrix. When `process.versions.oam` clears the floor, the server
 * is imported into THIS process exactly as the Node fallback is -- no
 * discovery, no `oam --version` probe, no second oam. OAM_BIN is a discovery
 * input, so it is not consulted on that path: the host has already chosen
 * which oam runs. Nothing is lost by staying in the host, because this launcher
 * passes oam no process-level flag that only a fresh oam could apply (see NO
 * SANDBOX HERE).
 *
 * A host oam BELOW the floor never serves. It used to, whenever discovery came
 * up empty. It now hands the server off to the newest usable oam, or to Node
 * found on PATH, or exits with an error when there is neither.
 *
 * That handoff PIPES stdio rather than inheriting it. Before 0.9.0 oam treated
 * `stdio: 'inherit'` as `'pipe'`, so an inherited handoff from such a host
 * connected the child to pipes nobody reads: measured with a real oam 0.8.2
 * host, the MCP handshake never answered. Piping the streams explicitly
 * completes it, to both oam and Node. A Node host keeps `inherit`, which hands
 * over the same fds untouched.
 *
 * NO SANDBOX HERE
 * oam is run with no `--permission` flags. The sandbox is simply not wired up
 * in this launcher today. That is not because this server would need wide-open
 * grants: it drives no Electron app, and it never has. An earlier version of
 * this header said it spawned app binaries, read project directories and
 * connected to DevTools endpoints. None of that was true.
 *
 * What the server does is pure in-process computation over its tool arguments
 * and embedded Electron knowledge. Some tools statically analyze code or build
 * output they are handed; the rest generate code, config, checklists or
 * explanations from built-in templates. Every tool returns markdown. Outside
 * its test files, `src/` spawns no process, opens no socket, makes no network
 * request, and reads no caller-supplied path. The `node:` import specifiers in
 * the tool modules are text inside the Electron code the tools generate, not
 * imports this process runs. The one filesystem touch is the server's own
 * package.json, read by `resolveVersionFromPackageJson` in src/version.ts, and
 * only on the tsc-only path: the shipped esbuild bundle substitutes
 * `__VERSION__`, so it never gets there. The launcher in this file does spawn
 * (the `oam --version` probes and the handoffs), but that is launcher code,
 * not the server.
 *
 * Wiring a sandbox up is a behaviour change and belongs in its own change.
 * @yawlabs/fetch-mcp shows the shape: an opt-in FETCH_MCP_SANDBOX=1. Such an
 * opt-in also has to skip the in-process path under ALREADY RUNNING ON OAM,
 * because only a freshly spawned oam can apply a process-level flag.
 *
 * MINIMUM OAM VERSION
 * The latest oam release, 0.15.2 -- bump OAM_MIN when oam ships a newer one.
 * Only the current oam is used and verified; an older one is handed off or
 * falls back to Node. Below 0.9.0 `child_process.execFile` ran its arguments
 * through a SHELL, `exec` accepted `timeout` and ignored it, `spawnSync`
 * truncated at `maxBuffer` while reporting success, and
 * `stdio: 'inherit'`/`'ignore'` both behaved as `'pipe'`. The server itself
 * spawns nothing (the only `child_process` imports in `src/` are in test
 * files), so those could not reach it; the floor is about serving only on the
 * oam release every @yawlabs/*-mcp launcher is verified on. The launcher's own
 * handoff from an old oam host does meet the `inherit` bug, which is why that
 * handoff pipes.
 *
 * SELECTION
 *   ELECTRON_MCP_RUNTIME=auto   newest usable oam, else Node (default)
 *   ELECTRON_MCP_RUNTIME=oam    newest usable oam, else exit with an error
 *                               (already running on oam at the floor satisfies it)
 *   ELECTRON_MCP_RUNTIME=node   Node: in THIS process on Node, handed off to
 *                               Node on PATH when THIS process is oam
 *   OAM_BIN=/path/to/oam        use this oam when it is usable, before discovery
 * The value is case-insensitive; anything else behaves like `auto`.
